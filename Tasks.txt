- case is a file, run the cmd without "file" - simply dedup <file>

- name files, without extension (creates a folder to add this file, necessary for oppose)
- oppose <file> <differ>

- test if a category already exists before creating it
- easier cmd

Updates which will break compatibility:
- for new de-duplicing, list all symlinks created with this program, and enables updating them when changing original file
- move </category/file> <category>
- can place files without needing to tell category (list all de-dupliced files)
- hash for de-duplicing files; prevent creating files for already de-dupliced files/folders
